# Eye_Tracking_Data_Processing_Pipeline

This selection of Matlab scripts reads asc files of SR research result files, detects fixation periods from markers in the file, summarizes samples to fixation locations, corrects data according to fixation events during the experiment, conducts ROIs analyses, calculates serveral eye tracking variables (e.g. number of fixations per trial, percent fixation time in ROI, average distance to ROI etc.) and visualizes data as heat maps.
